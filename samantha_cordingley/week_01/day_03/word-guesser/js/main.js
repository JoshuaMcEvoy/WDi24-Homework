/*Create two global arrays: one to hold the letters of the word
(e.g. 'F', 'O', 'X'), and one to hold the current guessed letters
(e.g. it would start with '_', '_', '_' and end with 'F', 'O', 'X').
Write a function called guessLetter that will:
Take one argument, the guessed letter.
Iterate through the word letters and see if the guessed letter is in there.
If the guessed letter matches a word letter, changed the guessed letters array to
reflect that.

//if guess DOES match a letter, store that letter in the correct index in guessed letters const

//else DOESN'T match a letter, don't change the guessed letters const

//after each guess return the current guessed letters cont
