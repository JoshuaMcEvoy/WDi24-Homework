// ~~~~~~~ WORD GUESS GAME ~~~~~~~~~~~

// You'll create a simple word guessing game where the user gets infinite tries to guess the word
// (like Hangman without the hangman, or like Wheel of Fortune without the wheel and fortune).


// Keep track of all the guessed letters (right and wrong)
const usedLetters = [];


// Keep track of the state of the hangman as a number (starting at 0)
let hangman = 0;


// create two global arrays:
// one to hold the letters of the word (e.g. 'F', 'O', 'X'),
const answerLetters = ['T', 'I', 'M', 'E'];
// and one to hold the current guessed letters (e.g. it would start with '_', '_', '_')
const guessedLetters = ['_','_','_', '_'];

// initialise variable for endgame check
let correctGuessCounter = 0;


const asciiArt = `_______\n|\/      |\n|      (_)\n|      \\|\/\n|       |\n|      \/ \\\n|\n________`;




// ---- function start ----
// write a function called guessLetter that will:
// take one argument, the guessed letter
const guessLetter = function (guessRaw) {
  // initialise guess flag
  let guessCorrect = false;
  // initialise used flag;
  let usedLetter = false;

  // convert input to uppercase so user can enter either upper or lower
  const guess = guessRaw.toUpperCase();

  // and only let the user guess a letter once. If they guess a letter twice, do nothing.
